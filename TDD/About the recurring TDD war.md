Test Driven Development has been around for 20+ years now. And I have been using and practicing it for 15 years; yet, I have been using alternatives method for 20 years before that.
I remember how sceptical I was when introduced to it, but I choose to embrace it as the change opportunity it provided. We were taught a bad version of XP, where the recommnded trigger to write a test was the need to write a **new method**.
It was a loss of time at first, and not very beneficial to the project we did that way; but for some unexplained reason, I got the intuition the problem was me, not the method. So I keep on reading about and practicing.
I had to unlearn many things I acquired in the first 20 years of my carreer; I also had to learn many new things.
Now I am confident with my TDD's skills; I know when not to use it, how to approach it on new  or pre existing projects, and I can teach it.

But it took me 15 fucking years to get there.
