# Personal project log
This document is my history with IT described through personal milestones. May be this is a bragging list, there is no disclaimer of fitness of purpose or any value whatsoever for anyone but me.
By building this list, I simply wanted to:

- keep track of what I have done
- maybe trends and/or patterns

This is listed in chronological order, with no specific structure as of V1.

# Beginnings
## my first computer (1983)
A ZX Spectrum 48; a 4Mhz 16/8 bits CPU, 48Ko RAM, integrated Basic, tape storage. It has been my single computer for 4 years, dabbled with Basic and switched to assembler after two years or so.

To this day, I still remember clearly the command `POKE 23659,0` and [what it does.](http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr02/yr02_27.htm).

### My first 'program' 
I don't remember my very first lines of code, but they were probably copied from the manual and written with my dad, since I did not understand English at the time.
At first, I spent most of my time playing with games.

What I consider to be my first personnal project was coding a puzzle game derived from a small tabletop game I found in a magazine (Jeux & Stratégie, April 1984).![Doctor Jekhyde](Jeux & Stratégie 026 - Page 021 (1984-04-05).jpg)

I implemented the game rules in BASIC, designed the (crude) graphics and debugged it in a couple of days. I did it mostly for education purpose, and was happy of achieving this as well as pretty much aware that it was not much more than a prototype.

This computer was later replaced by a ZX Spectrum+2 128Ko (due to some unfortunate accident involving myself tripping on the video cable).

My later (significant) projects were: 

- A copy program that was able to exploit the memory extension. As reading the tape required precise timing, the trick was to compensate for the time needed for memory bank switching.

## My first paid gig
My first professional gig gave me the opportunity to use a new platform: the Canon X07. This was a very small computer, kinda  like a pocket book in format, with 14940 bytes of available memory and a display of 4x16 characters. Along with it came a dozen of scribbled pages describing what the program was supposed to do.
It was an insurance fee estimator; dedicated to factory risks, it required getting between 20 and 30 input variables before outputing the estimaged fee(s) and covered amounts according to selected options.

I had a lot fun of working on this machine, despite it having such tiny keys and minuscule screen. It also was battery powered, and turned on and off instantly. ![Canon X07 Memory card](x07card.jpg)

You could save your program to battery powered memory cards. Memory limited you to maybe 4-500 lines of code, so it forced you to be creative in your design. Likewise, you could conect it to an external screen and I did not have access to a printer then; I had to remember the program structure to code.

I guess the program was at least a half success because I got feature requests afterward. The first one was to **provide a print out of the results**.
