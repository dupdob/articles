# On vendor lock-in
This post is a reaction to a recent [tweet from Mathias Verraes](https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/1134193520531705857).
In his tweet, Mathias challenges the existence of 'vendor lock-in',
considering it as a baseless fear.
In my book, vendor lock-in is an actual threat, and something that needs
proper care and attention
