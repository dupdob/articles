Codage, Conception et architecture

# Introduction
This series of articles have been long in the making. They result fuzzy ideas circling in my head for a couple of decades. These have never been cleared enough to be worth any considering, but now that I am reaching an age of wisdom, I start to understand the underpinning concept shared by all those idle thoughs.

**Systems**

I now realize that I have been (re)discovering systems thinking throughout my coder life. When I felt confortable enough with code writing, I enjoyed solving real world issues with code, 
While I am far from being an expert in systemics, I think it should be applied to development
praticies more deliberately, and at several level.
To be more specific, IT related activities should be considered as recursion of systems (systems within systems within systems), where each level inherits some emergent properties from the system(s) below and introduce some new ones.

# Notes
Approche systémique

Système 1
Dev <-> machine
Dev => code machine
Machine => résultats
