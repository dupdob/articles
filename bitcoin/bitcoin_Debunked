# Debunking Bitcoin related myths
_____

Each time **I see some bitcoin related BS on Twitter, I denounce it**. I often get
rebuttal from bitcoin fanboys, to which I provide justified answer. But
I am starting to be tired by this exercise, and Twitter is no medium for
a proper argument.

Being as lazy as the next developer, this post will contain all my concerns
about bitcoin, so that for the next argument, I will simply provide a link to
this article.

## Approach
I will debunk myths both from an implementation point of view as well as from
a theorical point of view.

## Disclaimer
I have a long experience in banking IT, and in distributed systems, real time
architecture and performance related issues. I am interested in Bitcoin from a
technical perspective as well as social dynamic perspective. It is a fascinating
software that offers inventing solution.
I am no expert,
and I am here to learn.


# Implementation concerns
## Performance
This is a well known issue: bitcoin has a throughput problem. Currently it tops
at less than 3 transactions, per second, worldwide.

As a benchmark value, Mastercard processes around 40,000 transactions per second.

Despite various evolutions, such as increasing the maximum size of blocks, the
transaction rates is actually decreasing.

And then, a BTC fanboy will fight with a brand new feature

## Lightning Networks allows unlimited transactions

TL, DR: **No, they don't**.

A somewhat longer answer is: **no, they  actually offer unlimited negotiations.**

Lightning Network is a clever solution from a technical perspective, allowing
to piggyback modifiable transactions on top of the the blockchain and providing
alternative fraud prevention strategy. Granted.
And those transactions can be modified quickly without going through the
relatively lengthy blockchain process, allowing **thousands of modifications
per second** per network. Hence it is scalable.

**Sounds great!**

At the macro level, you create a *channel* on the blockchain. This implies
recording a transaction on the blockchain; this is a specific kind of
transactions, but it happens at the same speed as any other transaction, i.e.
**3/seconds** worldwide.

But after that, you can publish several updates to this transaction at full speed
