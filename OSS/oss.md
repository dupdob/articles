Why open source has won the software component war?

# intro
Today commercial software applications remains the dominant model. The main change in the past decades has been the emergence of cheap applications, driven by the mobile app market.

On the software components front, there is no question that open source has basically crushed adversaries.
Remaining close source/proprietary software libraries are either on niche use cases (e.g. interoperability with some legacy hardware, or benefit from past investment (e.g. UI elements/visual component libraries).

This post offers rational for this situation, and provides useful hindsights for those interested in open source software.

# Specifics
I have been in and out software components all along my careers, mostly in, both in coding and using some. Nowadays, my coding time is exclusively spent working on open source software components.

# Free Time breeds creativity
It is a well known facts that constraints kill creativity. There is a clear advantage for OSS here: coders work on these projects whenever they want to, allowing ideas to grow and mature.
I have been able to fix some  NFluent shortcoming after a few weeks or months now of background thinking
This would not have been possible in a more structured environment
 For  company supported OSS (RedHad or Docker for example
